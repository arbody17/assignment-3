# 🤖 AI Usage Report – Assignment 3

## 🛠️ Tools Used
For Assignment 3, I used **ChatGPT** as my primary AI assistant to help expand and enhance my personal portfolio website.  
This phase focused on integrating **external APIs**, improving **state management**, implementing **complex logic**, and refining the overall **UI/UX** experience.

AI supported me in building several key features, including:
- 🐙 **GitHub API integration** to display my latest repositories dynamically  
- 💬 **Random Quote API** with a smart **local fallback system** when the API fails  
- 🔎 **Project filtering & sorting** using dataset attributes and saved user state  
- 🎨 **Improved project card layout**, spacing, and featured-card behavior  
- 🕒 **Visit counter** and **time-on-site timer** using `localStorage`  
- 🌗 Enhancements to the theme toggle and persistent user preferences  
- 📄 Assistance in writing and structuring documentation files

## 🚀 Benefits
Using AI during this phase boosted both my productivity and understanding of web development concepts.  
It helped me:

- Learn how to integrate **REST APIs** using `fetch`, `async/await`, and proper error handling  
- Create a **fallback system** to ensure reliability even when external APIs fail  
- Improve my knowledge of **state management** using `localStorage`  
- Understand how to structure JavaScript into **modular, reusable functions**  
- Build cleaner and more responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox  
- Solve UI spacing and alignment issues more efficiently  
- Strengthen my ability to debug and optimize client-side code  

AI made the development process smoother, but every feature was tested, understood, and customized by me.

## ⚠️ Challenges
AI assistance was helpful, but required careful oversight.  
Some challenges I faced:

- Certain suggested quote APIs had **CORS issues** or did not work on localhost  
- Some code needed to be adapted to match my existing HTML structure  
- Filtering + sorting required multiple revisions to work smoothly together  
- Visual layout changes sometimes caused spacing or alignment inconsistencies  

To solve these issues, I had to:
- Replace unstable APIs with better alternatives  
- Add a **local fallback** quote list  
- Debug DOM updates and grid behavior  
- Adjust CSS padding, gap, and alignment manually  

This improved my debugging skills and understanding of front-end logic.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
Through this assignment, I learned how to:

- Integrate **external APIs** into a front-end website  
- Handle API failures gracefully and design a **fallback strategy**  
- Manage multiple UI states using `localStorage`  
- Apply **complex logic** (filtering, sorting, timers) cleanly  
- Debug and optimize JavaScript for better performance  
- Write clearer, user-focused components with responsive design in mind  

Most importantly, I gained confidence in building more dynamic and interactive web applications.

## ✅ Responsible Use
I used ChatGPT responsibly as a **learning tool**, not as a replacement for understanding.  
Every suggestion was:

- Reviewed carefully  
- Tested in my code  
- Modified to fit my needs  
- Understood before being added  

The final work represents my own decisions, creativity, and implementation, enhanced through AI guidance.

## 📝 Reflection
This assignment showed me how effective human–AI collaboration can be.  
AI helped me think faster and solve problems creatively, while I controlled the logic, debugging, and final decisions.  

The result is a more **dynamic**, **reliable**, and **professional** portfolio website that reflects my growth as a developer.
